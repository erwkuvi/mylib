# mylib
Implementation of my own library
This project was all about understanding how many existing functions work and how to implement them. Mostly the functions manipulate memory and strings, but a few of them manipulate lists as well. 
I put a short description on the beginning of each function, you can also use the "man" command on the terminal, if you need more information.
